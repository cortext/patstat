# Enriching Patstat: Descriptions for the International Patent Classification 

## Goals
Patents have fine grained information to describe the technologies that are combined by the applications. The IPC divides technology into eight sections with approximately 70 000 subdivisions. Each subdivision has a symbol consisting of Arabic numerals and letters of the Latin alphabet.

A complete classification symbol comprises the combined symbols representing the 
section, class, subclass and main group or subgroup.
